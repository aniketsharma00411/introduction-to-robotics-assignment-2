Problem statement:

Write a program to transform frame A to frame B, then input position of a point in a frame and output position of the same point in another frame.

INPUT:

It takes 8 values from user which are as follows:

    1. (float) Angle in degrees by which to rotate frame A about x-axis
    2. (float) Angle in degreesby which to rotate frame A about y-axis
    3. (float) Angle in degreesby which to rotate frame A about z-axis
    4. (float) Distance in units by which to translate frame A about x-axis
    5. (float) Distance in units by which to translate frame A about y-axis
    6. (float) Distance in units by which to translate frame A about z-axis
    7. (character[A/B]) Frame in which the point is known to user
    8. (3 space-separated integers) Coordinates of the known point

OUTPUT:

    1. (numpy array) new coordinates
